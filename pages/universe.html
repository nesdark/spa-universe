<h1>The Universe</h1>

<p>
  The word Universe derives from the latin universum. The latin word was used by
  Cicero and later used by other authors with the current meaning. The latin
  word is derived from the poetic contraction unvorsum -- Primarily used by
  Lucretius in the Book IV of "On the Nature of Things" - Which connects un, uni
  (a) with vorsum, versum, (Meaning "Turned, rolled or changed")
